Hey everyone! I'm here in the back with my&nbsp;
disc golf gear. I wanted to give you all a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.680
look into my disc golf bag and the amount of&nbsp;
discs I kind of carry on any given day out on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.180
the disc golf course. It may look like a lot but&nbsp;
whenever you are throwing over water and may lose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.680
some you definitely want to have some extras,&nbsp;
and I have a few that I consider my "go-to's"&nbsp;

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.020
Generally Ikeep the up top. My putting putters&nbsp;
are fireflies. That's what I like to use when I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.540
am really close and I am jsut trying to put it&nbsp;
in the basket. Generally, off the tee I'll go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.340
with something a little faster, so I have a disc&nbsp;
called the rhythm that I really like throwing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.720
and then my absolute favorite is actually once you&nbsp;
get a little closer, just out of putting range,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.540
but just needing to get close is, uh,&nbsp;
what's called a rat. It's an approach disc.
