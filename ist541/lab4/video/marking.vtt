00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.040
In this disc golf training I want to&nbsp;
show you how to properly mark your lie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.140
and show how a marker is utilized.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.160
A marker is used in disc golf to mark your lie&nbsp;
and to give your plant foot a proper landing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.660
zone for your next shot. Your plant foot&nbsp;
is allowed an eight and a half by eleven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.760
inch space behind your marker, so think of a&nbsp;
piece of printer paper as your landing spot.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.120
A marker must always be placed at the&nbsp;
front of the disc going to the basket.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.840
If it's placed on the sides or the back, that's&nbsp;
an illegal mark, and that's an extra stroke.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.440
Another stroke would be planting your&nbsp;
foot NOTwithin your plant foot area.
